# aib-hackathon

An Open source project created at the Aib Hackathon 2018 (Pull Requests Welcome)
Theme: Inclusion

# Idea: 
Create an educational platform for refugees, migrants or new people landing on Irish SHores with little information about Ireland

# Why create this?
New people in our country can often feel a sense of confusion, loss of comfort, familiarity and cofidence due to their lack of knowledge about the place. To try and aid these people, we came up with the idea of creating Culture Hub, a centralized system that would allow for new people to learn more about topics that can be very intimidating to them.

# Current Main Focus Areas: 

1. History and Culture
2. Language
3. Social Aspects
4. Education

# Future Additions to Focus Areas:

5. Job Seeking Aids
6. Mental Health

# Landing page: 

Snippet with a description of Culture Hub and a guide to how to use culture hub. We plan to create an entire course on how to make the most of Culture Hub by learning what resources we have and where to look for them.
